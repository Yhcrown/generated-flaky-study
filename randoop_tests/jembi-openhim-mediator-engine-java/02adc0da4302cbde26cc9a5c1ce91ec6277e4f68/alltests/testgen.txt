About to look for flaky methods.

Flaky tests were generated. This means that your program contains
methods that are nondeterministic or depend on non-local state.
The following methods, in decreasing order of likelihood,
are the most likely to be the problem.
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse$Response.getTimestamp()
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse$Request.setTimestamp(java.util.Date)
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse$Request.getTimestamp()
  Possibly flaky:  java.util.Date.toString()
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse.toJSON()
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse.getProperties()
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse.toString()
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse$Response.getStatus()
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse.setResponse(org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse.Response)
  Possibly flaky:  org.openhim.mediator.engine.CoreResponse.getResponse()
To prevent the generation of flaky tests, see section 'Randoop generated flaky tests'
