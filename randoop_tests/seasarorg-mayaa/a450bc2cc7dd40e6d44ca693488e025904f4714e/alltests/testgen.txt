Randoop for Java version "4.3.2, local changes, branch master, commit df17bc8, 2023-01-08".
Cannot instantiate non-accessible interface org.seasar.mayaa.TODO specified via --testclass or --classlist.

Will try to generate tests for 369 out of 370 classes.

Wrote regression JUnit tests.
About to look for flaky methods.

Flaky tests were generated. This means that your program contains
methods that are nondeterministic or depend on non-local state.
The following methods, in decreasing order of likelihood,
are the most likely to be the problem.
  Possibly flaky:  org.seasar.mayaa.impl.CycleLocalVariablesImpl.clearGlobalVariable(java.lang.String)
To prevent the generation of flaky tests, see section 'Randoop generated flaky tests'
 at https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/#flaky-tests .
