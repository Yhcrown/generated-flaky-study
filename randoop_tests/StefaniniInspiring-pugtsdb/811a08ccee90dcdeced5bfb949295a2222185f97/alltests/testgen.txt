About to look for flaky methods.

Flaky tests were generated. This means that your program contains
methods that are nondeterministic or depend on non-local state.
The following methods, in decreasing order of likelihood,
are the most likely to be the problem.
  Possibly flaky:  com.inspiring.pugtsdb.time.Interval.toString()
  Possibly flaky:  com.inspiring.pugtsdb.time.Interval.getFromTime()
  Possibly flaky:  com.inspiring.pugtsdb.time.Interval$Builder.fromNow()
  Possibly flaky:  com.inspiring.pugtsdb.time.Interval$Builder.from(long)
  Possibly flaky:  com.inspiring.pugtsdb.time.Interval.getUntilTime()
  Possibly flaky:  com.inspiring.pugtsdb.time.Interval.ofLastWeeks(long)
  Possibly flaky:  com.inspiring.pugtsdb.time.Interval$Builder.fromWeeksAgo(long)
  Possibly flaky:  java.lang.String.valueOf(long)
  Possibly flaky:  java.lang.Long.valueOf(long)
  Possibly flaky:  java.lang.Long.toString(long)
